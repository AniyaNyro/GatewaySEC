    <h1>IMAGE | </h1><p>    The youth lack empowerment in their education to bring change to their communities and
    their lives. The school to prison pipeline counts on our youth to not be adequately informed to make their
    own decisions and preys on them to fill their prisons for profit. There needs to be immense change in our
    system of education and we need our students to be empowered to make those changes.
    </p>
    <p>     In this industry we have organizations that put on events and have resources for the youth but no one
    actually organizes the youth, teach them how to be leaders, and build their vision. We are making a way
    to invest is a long-term solution that organizes the youth.
